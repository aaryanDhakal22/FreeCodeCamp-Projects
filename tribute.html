  <h2> History: </h2>
  <p style="font-size: 15px">Gilmour purchased the guitar, a 1969 model with a maple cap fingerboard and large headstock, in 1970 from Manny's Music in New York City to replace a similar guitar his parents bought him for his 21st birthday, which had been lost while touring with Pink Floyd in the United States in 1968. The Black Strat was originally a sunburst colour, but had been repainted black at Manny's. Since then, it has undergone numerous modifications. </p>
  <p style="font-size: 15px">Initially it had the following specs:</p>
  <ul >
<li> Alder body</li>
<li>Rosewood neck with large headstock</li>
<li>Sunburst finish</li>
<li>Fender late 60's single-coil pickups</li>
<li>3-ply white pickguard</li>
<li>Fender tuning machine</li>
<li>Fender synchronized tremolo bridge with normal size arm.</li>
<li>3-way selector switch</li>
 </ul>
 <hr>
 <h2> Modifications done to the guitar:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1983 reissue Maple neck with normak headstock</li>
<li>Black paintjob</li>
<li> Fender 1971 reissue pickups in neck and middle and Seymour Duncan custom wound SSL-1C bridge pickup</li>
<li>1-ply black pickguiard</li>
<li>Gotho vintage tuning machine</li>
<li>Custom mini-toggle switch on the pickguard for neck/bridge combo</li>
<li>5-way selector switch</li>
<li>Fender synchronized tremolo bridge with short size arm.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2> Sale: </h2>
  <p style="font-size: 15px" >In early 2019 Gilmour announced he would auction many of his guitars for charity, including the Black Strat and the #0001 Strat. On June 20, 2019, the Black Strat sold for a price of US$3,975,000, becoming the most expensive guitar ever sold at that time. The guitar was purchased by guitar collector and Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay. That record was broken on June 20, 2020, when Kurt Cobain's 1959 Martin D-18E sold at a Beverly Hills auction for US$5,000,000 (US$6,100,000 after buyer's premium and related expenses) to Peter Freedman, co-founder of RÃ¸de Microphones. It was the guitar Cobain used when Nirvana taped its MTV Unplugged performance on November 18, 1993. </p>
